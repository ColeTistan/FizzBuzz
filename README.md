# FizzBuzz
Fizz buzz is a game played by children to help teach them about division in elementary mathematics. 
This game has also become popular by programmers to practice the syntax of a new programming language they are learning,
which I demonstrated with numerous programming languages I have learned throughout the years. 

The languages that I used to approach the Fizz Buzz problem include the following:
- PHP
- Ada
- C
- C#
- C++
- Java
- JavaScript
- Python
